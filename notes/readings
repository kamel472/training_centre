- require(): 
If an error occurs, generates a fatal error, and the script will stop.


- include():
If an error occurs, generates a warning, but the script will continue execution
if you want the execution to go on and show users the output, even if the include file is missing, use the include statement.

- The require_once() statement is identical to require() except PHP will check if the file has already been included, and if so, not include (require) it again
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- fatal error: where PHP compiler understand the PHP code but it recognizes an undeclared function and crash your program.
- warning error:  The main reason of these errors are including a missing file
- notice error: It means that the program contains something wrong but it allows the execution of script.
- parse error/syntax error: is caught by the compiler (e.g. missing semicolon)
